				<h3>What could Jump out of the internet?</h3>
				<p>After discussing the project and learning more about Internet Yama-Ichi I started thinking about what could come out of the internet and into the real world. I thought about this for a while until I got the idea of something actually jumping out of the computer and into the real world. What if I created a program that when given data by a customer at the market, it takes all the data and creates a little person/ figure that is then sent into the real world which represents this data.</p>

				<h3>Background Info..</h3>
				<p>I remembered a while ago that Walter gave a lecture on the Cambridge Analytica where millions of Facebook users were robbed of their privacy when all of their Facebook data was collected without them knowing through a program. What if my program was like this. At the market the user would have to search their Facebook on the program I am going to call AVATAR. Once found the program will then collect all the Facebook data, analyse it, create an Avatar of the person out of it and then spit it out into the real world as a little action figure.</p>

				<h3>Making the product</h3>
				<p>If I am going to sell these Avatars at the a Internet Yama-Ichi I will need to pre make physical version of them. To do this I made an outline of a cartoon Avatar then laser cut the shape out of multiple bits of card. I glued the card together to create a thicker model that could stand up on its own. At the market I would then create an Avatar through the program (I just designed them myself), print it out and then stick it onto the blank model. The customer now has their own mini version of themselves. </p>

				<h3>The Set Up</h3>
				<p>Now that I had the models and the story behind them I just needed a way to present it without me having to be there. For this I created a slide show that explained how the Avatars were created and what they looked like. I also had a page showing who the trial Avatars were based off. This was last and final step of my project. I now had a back story behind the idea, the physical models and a presentation for the Internet Yama-Ichi.  </p>
